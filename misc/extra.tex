\subsection{Possible work}
%Possible improvements which could be carried out for the project

%------Zeph Alogrithmn
-In future work, we will extend Zeph to IPv6 and analyze in depth
the dynamics of the internet topology

%-----MDA algorithm
-We see a number of possible extensions to the MDA. Better
knowledge of the hashing functions used by per-flow load bal-
ancers [4] should make it possible to reduce probing overhead,
with the possibility to revert to the MDA in cases where no
predictable pattern can be identified with high certainty. There
is considerable scope for improving the current (loose) failure
bound, thereby saving probes, and both the significance level
and failure analyses open up new avenues for trading off and
optimizing performance against probe budget. Another open
question is how to accurately trace multipath routes past per-
packet load balancers.

%-----Diamond miner
Our empirical data suggests that there are a set of load bal-
anced architectures common to different provider types, for
instance those deployed in data centers versus mobile opera-
tors versus transit providers. We believe there is significant
opportunity to develop a taxonomy of these common archi-
tectures and classify results accordingly, as well as to identify
previously unidentified load balanced architectures that are
deployed in the wild. Comprehensive mapping of some of
these topologies may require probing both from outside and
within the providerâ€™s network; we leave an exploration of e.g.,
internal data center probing to future work.

-Introduce more tracerouting strategies: at the moment it sends all the packets at once

-send more than one packet per hop (traceroute sends 3 packets per hop) \textit{Could implement MDA/MDA lite in conjunction with dublin traceroute also maybe zeph alogrithm}

-IPv6 probes in the C++ library (already implemented in the Go codebase)

-support for TCP, ICMP, and DNS probes

-add Path MTU Discovery to detect latencies introduced by fragmentation
