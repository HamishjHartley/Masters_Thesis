abstract = {We describe a new system for distributed tracing at the IP level of the routes that packets take through the IPv4 internet. Our Zeph algorithm coordinates route tracing efforts across agents at multiple vantage points, assigning to each agent a number of /24 destination prefixes in proportion to its probing budget and chosen according to a reinforcement learning heuristic that aims to maximize the number of multipath links discovered. Zeph runs on top of Iris, our fault tolerant system for orchestrating internet measurements across distributed agents of heterogeneous probing capacities. Iris is built around third party free open source software and modern containerization technology, thereby presenting a new model for assembling a resilient and maintainable internet measurement architecture. We show that carefully choosing the destinations to probe from which vantage point matters to optimize topology discovery and that a system can learn which assignment will maximize the overall discovery based on previous measurements. After 10 cycles of probing, Zeph is capable of discovering 2.4M nodes and 10M links in a cycle of 6 hours, when deployed on 5 Iris agents. This is at least 2 times more nodes and 5 times more links than other production systems for the same number of prefixes probed.},

abstract = {Traceroute is widely used, from the diagnosis of network problems to the assemblage of internet maps. However, there are a few serious problems with this tool, in particular due to the presence of load balancing routers in the network. This paper describes a number of anomalies that arise in nearly all traceroute-based measurements. We categorize them as "loops", "cycles", and "diamonds". We provide a new publicly-available traceroute, called Paris traceroute, which controls packet header contents to obtain a more precise picture of the actual routes that packets follow. This new tool allows us to find conclusive explanations for some of the anomalies, and to suggest possible causes for others.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in 2006--2007, Paris Traceroute and its Multipath Detection Algorithm (MDA) have been used to conduct well over a billion IP level multipath route traces from platforms such as M-Lab. Unfortunately, the MDA requires a large number of packets in order to trace an entire topology of load balanced paths between a source and a destination, which makes it undesirable for platforms that otherwise deploy Paris Traceroute, such as RIPE Atlas. In this paper we present a major update to the Paris Traceroute tool. Our contributions are: (1) MDA-Lite, an alternative to the MDA that significantly cuts overhead while maintaining a low failure probability; (2) Fakeroute, a simulator that enables validation of a multipath route tracing tool's adherence to its claimed failure probability bounds; (3) multilevel multipath route tracing, with, for the first time, a Traceroute tool that provides a router-level view of multipath routes; and (4) surveys at both the IP and router levels of multipath routing in the Internet, showing, among other things, that load balancing topologies have increased in size well beyond what has been previously reported as recently as 2016. The data and the software underlying these results are publicly available.},

From the origins of the six degrees of separation to explaining why networks are robust to random failures, the author explores how viruses like Ebola and H1N1 spread, and why it is that our friends have more friends than we do.
