\section{Recommendations and conclusions}

% Discuss how in topology generation / simulation that several extra layers of complexity have not been covered in this report, outline how they possibly could be going forward in future. Such as router image, router configuration, linking protocols, load-balancing, NAT's, ip obsucation, VPNs, etc.

% Discuss Limitations of evaluation metric

% Discuss improvements for the contemporary methods

% Discuss/ Propose new approach to scanning networks, away from the traceroute bases approach and something novel. 

% Discuss symmetry between randomly generated networks and real-world networks

% Discuss other random network generation techniques

% Expand on proposed Topology library generated structure concept - could be an interesting contribution.
