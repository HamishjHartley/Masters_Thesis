\section{Recommendations and conclusions}

\subsection{Recommendations}
% Discuss how in topology generation / simulation that several extra layers of complexity have not been covered in this report, outline how they possibly could be going forward in future. Such as router image, router configuration, linking protocols, load-balancing, NAT's, ip obsucation, VPNs, etc.
Further work is needed to establish the suitability of generated topology models, through simulation and testing using [Insert measurement techniques here]. Furthermore, whilst a network topology can represent the overall structure of a network it does not capture the full complexity and layers which are present in such an environment. One such example of a characteristic which has not been covered is configuration of each individual node/router in the network, which in a real-world scenario can have significant effects of the behaviour of how traffic flows through such networks. This includes, load-balancing which is commonly employed to ensure even traffic flow in a network. 

% Discuss Limitations of evaluation metric

% Discuss improvements for the contemporary methods

% Discuss/ Propose new approach to scanning networks, away from the traceroute bases approach and something novel. 

% Discuss symmetry between randomly generated networks and real-world networks

% Discuss other random network generation techniques

% Expand on proposed Topology library generated structure concept - could be an interesting contribution.

% Discuss other topology modalities, i.e Peer2Peer
